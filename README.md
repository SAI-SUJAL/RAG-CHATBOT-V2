### **RAG Chatbot for Context-Free Responses**

**Description:**

This project is an advanced AI chatbot that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide context-free and accurate responses. The chatbot is designed to continuously learn from new data and user feedback, enhancing its ability to deliver precise answers over time. The core of the chatbot utilizes models like Meta-Llama-3 accessed via the Hugging Face API, combined with ChromaDB for document storage, and Neo4j graph databases for managing relationships and connections between data points.

**Features:**

- **Context-Free Responses:** The chatbot is designed to provide accurate answers without relying on the conversation's context, making it versatile for various applications.
- **Continuous Learning:** Implements a feedback mechanism to learn from user interactions, improving response accuracy over time.
- **Advanced AI Models:** Utilizes state-of-the-art models like Meta-Llama-3, accessed through the Hugging Face API, for generating high-quality responses.
- **Data Management:** Incorporates ChromaDB for storing and retrieving documents, and Neo4j graph databases for managing complex relationships between data entities.
- **Customizable Configuration:** The chatbot's architecture is designed for flexibility, allowing users to tailor the model configurations, paths, and other settings to their specific needs.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Hugging Face API:** For accessing AI models like Meta-Llama-3.
- **ChromaDB:** For document storage and retrieval.
- **Neo4j:** Graph database for managing relationships and connections.
- **Python:** The primary programming language for the project.
- **Git:** Version control for managing code changes and collaboration.

This project serves as a robust foundation for developing AI-driven applications that require accurate and context-independent responses. It is ideal for developers and researchers looking to build sophisticated AI systems with advanced data management and learning capabilities.
